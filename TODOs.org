* Doing
  Pruning the unecessary stuff.
  Might need to add electrodes in the stimreq class.
  Should the List -> Int part be done here, or on 
  SHODAN?

* TODO Investigate if I can axe the read/write stuff
  Now that the DSP crashes significantly less it might not
  be necessary to read and write using auxillary methods.
  
* TODO Freeze MEAME2 API
  Figure out stimulus, and we are very close to ready here boys
** TODO Stim site configuration API
   Like DAQ conf, the layout of stim should be done at conf time,
   not at request time. Dynamically reconfiguring this is very
   far from a priority.
