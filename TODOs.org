* Specs
** Should be able to handle all nescessary interfacing with MCS hardware
*** Flashing
*** Getting data
*** Stimulating
** Should offer an API to the outside world
*** Provide API for listening to channels
*** Provide API for sending stimuli
*** Provide API for starting/stopping HW
*** Possibly provide API for flashing

* Notes and thoughts
  Use HTTP REST API.
  A GET with information about channels etc should return either a success
  and a port for getting raw data, or a failure with a reason as to why
  (equipment not on, equipment not working etc etc)

  The server can
** Check for devices, provide device info
** Configure DAQ
** Start DAQ
