* Notes from original code
** uses the following:
*** setSelectData
*** AddSelecteChannelsQueue
*** ChannelBlock_SetCommonThreshold


* Next time
  Tests on DSP is fucktacular and no one on st.olavs are responding to reset requests xD

* DSP
  to write:
  if DSP is ready
  MEAME increment write REQ counter
  MEAME writes Address
  MEAME writes Data
  MEAME writes Req counter
  DSP is now in not ready status
  MEAME polls DSP ACK
  when DSP ACK = REQ we know our values have been written
  MEAME sets DSP to ready
  
  to read:
  if DSP is ready
  MEAME increase read REQ counter
  MEAME writes Address
  MEAME writes REQ counter
  DSP is now in not ready status
  MEAME polls DSP ACK
  DSP writes value to READ_DATA
  DSP writes REQ to ACK
  MEAME sets DSP to ready
